Hannes H.
-BS. Computer science
-M.D. and Dr.D. in "Miðlunartækni og vísindum" (computer science specialized not sure about translation)
-Dósent (department head?) in computer science
-computer skills: very good
-little experience in robotics, people around him were dsigning lego Mindstorm. Mostly just tinkering.
UI test
-explained as a phone app might bias
-Robot setup intuative (confusing becuse of module 1,2,3 instead of Drive MOdule or something simple).
-Wanted to have the automatic scaning of modules (assumed that the base would not be modular aswell)
-control test : intuative "needs a rotation icon instead of arrow" , "no start or stop so i must assume that this is direct controll"
Physical test
-got how the robot would work when leg module was shown.

"Classic", "intresting" , "the old classic is logo turtle" , "the kids would have to moce that robot with code, ... they can also attach a marker to try to make the robot draw shapes"(our plans already). 
-no spesific reaction to the path sketcher
"once you have some automation then you already have it better then the turtle bot as it had only hard programming"
"The lego mindstorm added sensors so this is more close to that, line followers are classic"
"using computers as a control system is intresting becuse we dont normaly make computers act alot on the physical world at the moment so this is intresting".
-Robox learning (competetor 10 years old for kids)
"Classic"
"Needs a twist on the classic"
Skema had a learning thing used scratch? to control robots (probably new lego mindstorm)
-self configurable robot has all the modules there and tries to configure as he goes and reconfigures once a challange is met (snake robots basicly) . "as the robot goes it gets modules as it goes (the game snake?)"
Talked a bunch about about self replicating robot forgot the term note bobiverse
Liquid robot like in terminator (where si this man going?)
"kids should learn to control robots themself instead of getting pre configured packeges"
summary : liked the concept needs some type of a twist.
